# Demo 1: interactive class on clustering with topology

## Outline

We will follow the notebook `class-notebook.ipynb` and we will start the exercise described in `exercise-notebook.ipynb`.

## Installing git

Please install git on your machine by following the directions in 

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

## Installing dependencies

We will use two more packages, on top of the ones that you installed for HW1.
You can install these packages by first activating the course's conda environment
```
conda activate TDA
```

and then running

```
pip install pandas
pip install git+https://github.com/LuisScoccola/persistable.git@experimental
```

## Getting the files

You have three options:

1. Clone the github repository using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/joperea/TDA-Spring2023.git
```
If you already cloned it for HW1, you can just do `git pull origin main` from the root of the repository to download the new files.
2. Download the files manually by clicking on them, then on "raw", and then right click > save as. Remember to change the .txt extension to the suitable extension (.ipynb for jupyter notebooks and .py for python files).
3. Download a zip with the entire repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/joperea/TDA-Spring2023/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
